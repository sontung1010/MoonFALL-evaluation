# C3: Calculator

In the file `calculator.py` is the starter code to implementing a simple calculator in python 3. For this challenge, the goal is to implement a simple calculator that takes in an infix addition statement as a string (i.e. `"3 + 2"`) and outputs the result.

There will only be 2 operands, meaning only 2 numbers are being added together. You will receive an unsanitized string containing the infix statement and must evaluate the result. The focus of this implementation should be to consider potential edge cases for the input and handle those gracefully. As a sample, some potential inputs could be `"2+2"`, `"2 * 2"`, `"pineapple"`, etc. Handle as many edge cases as you can think of, and comment the situations you are targeting with code segments.
You can add whatever functions you need, just do not change the headers of the existing functions. Feel free to use any outside libraries that do not need to be pip installed (numpy, scipy, etc
